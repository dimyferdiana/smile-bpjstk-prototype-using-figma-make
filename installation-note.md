Based on your ARCHITECTURE.md, hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan to start building your Design System Hub project:

1. Project Setup
Initialize the project with React + TypeScript.
Install Tailwind CSS v4.0 and configure with custom design tokens.
Set up folder structure as described in the architecture (components, hooks, imports, styles, utils).
Install dependencies:
UI: shadcn/ui, lucide-react, sonner, recharts, react-hook-form
Tooling: eslint, prettier, storybook (optional for docs/testing)
2. Core Layout & Navigation
Build the main layout in App.tsx:
Sidebar (AppSidebar)
Top navigation (TopNavigation)
Content area with tab management
Implement responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints.
3. Tab Management System
Create custom hook useTabManager for tab state.
Build tab components in tabs:
TabBar.tsx, TabContent.tsx, TabItem.tsx, TabPreview.tsx
Add tab persistence (local storage).
4. Design System Pages
Create documentation pages for:
Color system
Typography
Component library (showcase ShadCN components)
Layout system
Integrate Figma assets in imports and figma.
5. Memo Pencairan Anggaran System
Set up memo system in memo:
Memo tabs, forms, mock database, types
Implement CRUD operations and validation.
6. UI Component Library
Integrate ShadCN UI components in ui.
Document and showcase each component.
7. Advanced Features
Implement search modal with fuzzy matching.
Add toast notifications using Sonner.
Theme system: Light/dark mode, brand theming.
8. Testing & Documentation
Set up Storybook for component documentation.
Write unit tests for hooks and components.
Document usage in code and markdown files.
9. Performance & Accessibility
Optimize performance: lazy loading, memoization, bundle splitting.
Ensure accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management.
10. Deployment
Configure build system for production.
Set up CI/CD (optional).
Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred platform.
Tip:
Start with the core layout and navigation, then incrementally add features (tabs, design system, memo system, etc.). Use your ARCHITECTURE.md as a checklist and reference.
